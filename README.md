# Image play in Go

## Prerequisites

## Big part of this repository was based on the knowledge I received from Todd McLeod and his `Code Clinic: Go` course.

This package was created in order to learn Go programming language. It is not production quality.  
The premise of this repository is build around image analysis, computation and matching.

Main learning received from this project:
 * Knowledge about the building blocks and structures in Go
 * Working with libraries and documentation
 * Forming repository into library like architecture
 * Working with go executables on a machine
 * Working with go commands and variables
 * Concurrency and its benefits
 * Type, structs and interfaces
 * Testing and documentation from a user perspective

Future of this library is still unknown. Go is a very enjoyable language to work in.

## How to run

In the root directory of the package run `go run run.go`.
